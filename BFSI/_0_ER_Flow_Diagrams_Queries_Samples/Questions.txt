SQL / HIVE / SPARK [BATCH]

Generate ER Specific sample data from https://mockaroo.com/
====================
*)Find the total current cash flow branch wise
*)ATM transactions report max usage/city wise
*)Creditcard holders with higher limits and good cibil scores
*)Loans outstanding EMI Tracker
*)Monthly transactions report
*)New account openings report
*)List of Accounts with less than minimum balance applying for credit facilities

[STREAM]

Based on SampleData1.csv 
====================
^)Ignore the fact that amounts are not in 100s
^)Check line no 24-31,151-154,251-254
^)Based on Lat/Long it is visible that in some cases for same atmcard,multiple transactions have happened instantly,at physical distance exceeding 500 meters which is impossible humanly.
^)Use the ‘haversine’ formula to calculate distance https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html 
====================
*)Create a stateless batch to track & block fraudelant ATM Cards
*)In a defined window,find out the ATMs where frauds are happening,so that corrective actions can be initiated
*)maintain stateful info about ATM_Code+ATM_Type, so that concerned Banks can be notified
====================
^)Batch,Window should be customizable
^)Generate more data if required for runtime visualization
